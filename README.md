# Project Part Two: Video Game Database 

My project part two is a basic video game database that uses PHP and MySQL to query results

I decided to build off of my project part 1 and create something new with my knowledge from this semester

1. Cleaned up the JS and CSS 
2. Added a call to the News API to give the latest news from IGN in JSON format
3. Added PHP to allow server functionality
4. Created a database to allow querying and a search page

My main goal here was to develop a true web application with functionality to build off of my part 1, which was just a flat file with limited JS and CSS functionality.
